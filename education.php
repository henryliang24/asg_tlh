            GEOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE
            <br>
            <br> Tropical rainforests lie in the "tropics" between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer. In this region, sunlight hits the earth at an angle of about 90 degrees, resulting in intense solar energy. This intensity is due to the constant equatorial length of the day: 12 hours a day, 365 days a year. This steady sunlight provides the necessary energy to power the forest through photosynthesis.
            <br>
            <br> Due to the high solar energy, tropical rainforests like the Amazon are usually warm year round, with temperatures of 22-34 ° C, although forests at higher elevations, especially in cloud forests, are much cooler. The temperature may vary during the year, but in some equatorial forests the average may only be a few degrees throughout the year. Temperatures are generally mitigated by cloudiness and high humidity.

            TROPICAL RAINFOREST ECOSYSTEM
            <br>
            <br> Tropical rainforests exist in three major global areas: Central and South America, Africa and Indo-Malaysia. They are aptly called rainforests, which average between 125 and 660 cm of precipitation per year.
            <br>
            <br> Tropical rainforests are usually found near the equator, so that direct sunlight is possible in any habitat. Therefore, there is no cold season. The temperatures are on average between 20 ° C and 34 ° C. The combination of heat and rain creates a very humid environment. The warm air stores the water vapor, but as the air rises and cools, clouds form, producing more rain.
